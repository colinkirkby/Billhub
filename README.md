BillHub is an online web application that allows users to track their spending habits and anonymously share this information for the benefit of others. Through their BillHub accounts families and individuals will be able to track their financial habits. They will also be able to see the average living costs and expense breakdowns for different regions. This functionality will be beneficial to international students, travellers and job seekers looking to find information on what kinds of expenses they will need to be prepared for.  For registered users, BillHub will offer financial assessments allowing them to see where they are spending their money and where they could potentially be saving money. The app will offer these users a further breakdown of their spending over time, as well as the change in living expenses undergone by a region. Registered users will have the option of whether or not they would like their data to be anonymously contributed to the average living costs by region. Though there are similar websites that offer financial services, by offering free financial assessments and living cost breakdowns by region BillHub will be an invaluable tool for a large audience.
